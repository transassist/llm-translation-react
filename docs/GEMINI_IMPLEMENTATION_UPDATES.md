# Gemini Implementation Updates for LLM TR Project

## Summary of Changes
I've updated the Gemini implementation in your LLM TR project to support the latest models and features available as of March 2025. This includes the new Gemini 2.0 models, updated pricing, and enhanced capabilities.

## Key Updates

### 1. Updated Models List
Added the latest Gemini models in `constants.ts`:
- **Gemini 2.0 Pro** - Premium+ tier model
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash** - Premium tier model
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite** - Fast tier model
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro (Latest)** - Advanced tier model
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash (Latest)** - Standard tier model
- Added legacy versions (001) for backward compatibility

### 2. Updated Package Dependency
- Updated `@google/generative-ai` from version 0.24.0 to 0.31.0 in `package.json`

### 3. Updated Pricing Information
Updated the token pricing for all Gemini models in `api-client.ts`:
- Gemini 2.0 Pro: $0.0075 per 1K tokens
- Gemini 2.0 Flash: $0.0035 per 1K tokens
- Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite: $0.001 per 1K tokens
- Gemini 1.5 Pro/Flash: Maintained existing pricing

### 4. Enhanced Gemini API Integration
Updated the Gemini API proxy implementation in `gemini-proxy/route.ts`:
- Increased token limits for Gemini 2.0 models (up to 10,240 tokens)
- Added support for Gemini 2.0's multimodal output capabilities
- Added systemInstruction parameter for Gemini 2.0 models
- Enhanced response handling to process potential inline images

### 5. Model Utilities Updates
Updated the `model-utils.ts` file:
- Updated the latest model information to "gemini-2.0-pro"
- Enhanced the `formatModelName` function to handle the new model naming conventions
- Added special handling for legacy models with "-latest" and "-001" suffixes

## Implementation Notes
- Gemini 2.0 models have higher token limits and can handle longer contexts
- Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite is a new cost-efficient model option
- Multimodal output is now supported in Gemini 2.0 models (for non-post-editing tasks)
- I've maintained backward compatibility with older Gemini models

## Next Steps
1. Run `npm install` to update the Gemini SDK dependency
2. Test the application with the new Gemini models
3. Consider creating example prompts that leverage Gemini 2.0's enhanced capabilities

The system will automatically select the appropriate API parameters based on the model selected by the user, ensuring optimal performance with all Gemini model versions.
